    "American football, celebrated as a blend of strategy, physical prowess, and technological innovation, attracts millions of fans globally. The National Football League (NFL), at the forefront of adopting cutting-edge technologies, has consistently sought to enhance player safety and fan engagement through advanced data analytics and machine learning. In recent years, the integration of Amazon Web Services (AWS) into the NFL has marked a significant evolution in how data is utilized to reshape the sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collaboration between the NFL and AWS centers around transforming vast volumes of game data into actionable insights. AWS’s robust cloud infrastructure and machine learning services offer the NFL the tools necessary to process and analyze game footage, player statistics, and biometric data at an unprecedented scale and speed. This partnership not only aims to reduce injuries through better predictive models but also enhances game strategies, ultimately elevating the viewing experience for fans worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Driven by a passion for the convergence of sports and technology, this project delves into the multifaceted role of AWS within the NFL. I will explore how AWS’s deployment of machine learning and cloud computing is not merely a back-end improvement but a pivotal factor in the league’s ongoing initiatives to improve safety measures, optimize game strategies, and engage a global audience. Furthermore, the project will illustrate the specific AWS tools and machine learning models at work and evaluate their impact on various aspects of the NFL, from player training and game planning to fan interactions and broadcast enhancements."

    "The partnership between AWS and the NFL, facilitated through the Next Gen Stats platform, exemplifies the integration of cloud computing and machine learning to transform football. This platform leverages AWS's powerful cloud infrastructure to process extensive game data in real time, enabling advanced analytics on player metrics such as speed, distances covered, and play formations. These insights assist coaches and players in refining strategies and enhancing performance while enriching the fan experience with deeper analytical access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in 2017, AWS began partnering with the NFL to create Next Gen Stats. The goal was to change the way the NFL works with stats which in turn allows the NFL to make adjustments and ultimately make the game more enjoyable to watch. After reading Larry Hardesty's article titled \"How AWS scientists help create the NFL’s Next Gen Stats\" I got some good insight into how AWS actually tracks and predicts stats. Next Gen Stats is backed by AWS and specificlly utilizes Amazon SageMaker. SageMaker is allows for machine learning jobs to be developed and deployed on a cloud. The deep learning model that AWS uses gets its data from radio id chips inside of players shoulderpads. Each chip gives each players exact positional data in real time. There is alot of data that is gathered so to find the features with the most wieght, the team at net gen stats utilizes gradient boosting. gradient boosting works similarly to a nerual network however it is much less accurate. The purpose is to find exactly what features effect the algorithm the most. After those features were found they are able to predict players movements on the field. The result of this is a more in depth look at individual players decicion making.\n"
